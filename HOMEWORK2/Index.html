<h1>"Authentic Pho Recipe" I found online</h1>
Phở or pho is a Vietnamese soup consisting of broth,</br>
rice noodles called bánh phở, a few herbs, and meat,</br>
primarily made with either beef (phở bò) or chicken (phở gà)</br>
This dish is my favorite dish. It is something i gree up eating.</br>
The recipe here is oen i found online. The reason i didn't</br>
post my mother's recipe is because she does not have a written</br>
one that she follows and every pot she makes is a little different.
